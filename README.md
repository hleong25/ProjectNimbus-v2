# Nimbus v2

Second attempt to create a cloud storage manager.

It is for users that have mutliple cloud storage accounts, and want a single interface to connec to all of them.

It would provide a unified experience on all cloud storage platforms by adding features that the native cloud storage platform does not.

Future features:

- automatic encryption on upload, auto decryption on download
- split file into multiple segements and upload to multiple accounts so it would be scattered
- streaming audio and video files
